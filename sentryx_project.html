            <h1>The Sentry-X Project</h1>
        </div>
        <div id="div_project_content">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Sentry-X platform's primary use is to manage OTP (one time Pin) codes used by armed response companies to 
                gain access to the client's property. This is used in conjunction with a wireless keypad. A 6 digit random code 
                is issued using the platform. This code is then send to the armed response officer, where the officer enters the 
                code into the keypad. If the code is successful access is gained.
            </p>
            <h3>Methodologies/Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                    This platform is developed using Microsoft's Web development environment. 
                    The project was set up using the MVC (model view controller) structure used within visual studio IDE. 
            </p>
            <h3>System Design</h3>
            <p>The system consists of the following: UI, MySQL Database, Server-Side, and Web API
                <ul>
                    <li>Front End</li>
                    <li>MySQL Database</li>
                    <li>Server-Side Implementation</li>
                    <li>Web API</li>
                </ul>
                <u>Front End</u><br/>
                The front end is the user interface that the users interact with. The UI was designed using Html, CSS and
                <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> that is an open source toolkit for controls like 
                the buttons, cards, tables, badges, modal dialogs, etc. The web pages are located under the Views section of the
                MVC. Some JavaScript was used when passing data between the controller and the modal dialogs before it is 
                displayed to the user. Razor which is Microsoft's client side scripting language was also used to do some client 
                side processing. <br/>

            <p>
                When a client is created a profile and folder are created. The folder is used to store all the keypad files that are
                related to that client. 
                An encryption format called AES (Advanced Encrytion Standard) is used to encrypt all the infomation in the database and 
                folders.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                User priviledges can also be set up. These changes can only be done by a master user. Figure 2 shows the table to manage
                the users on the platform.
